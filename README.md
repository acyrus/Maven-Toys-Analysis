# Maven Toys Analysis
Sales and Inventory analysis of the Maven Toys Chain Stores in Mexico, using SQL and PowerBI.

# Overview
We have been provided with sales & inventory data for a fictitious chain of toy stores in Mexico called Maven Toys, 
including information about products, stores, daily sales transactions, and current inventory levels at each location. 

The data spans from January 1st 2017 to September 30th 2018, containing over 820,000 transactions for all stores owned by Maven Toys. 

The objective is to prepare the data, analyze and visualize it, and subsequently outline findings which allow the toy store chain to 
enhance its decision making capabilities and boost profits. 

The major questions that we will attempt to answer are:
1) Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?
2) Are there any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?
3) Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?
4) How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

# Data Colletion
The data used within this project is provided from the following link:  
[Maven Toys Sales | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mysarahmadbhat/toy-sales)

We are given four tables in CSV format which contain the following fields:

### Products (35 unique products)
1) Product_ID - Unique ID given to each product offered  
2) Product_Name - Unique name given to each product offered  
3) Product_Category - Category group assigned to each product based on its characteristics/utility  
4) Product_Cost - Expense incurred for making/attaining the product, in US dollars  
5) Product_Price - Price at which the product is sold to customers, in US dollars   

### Stores (50 different stores)

# Data Preparation:
Given the nature of the information provided, it is beneficial to place it into a MySQL database. 
The data has been separated into multiple tables that can be linked to each other based on identical fields. 
Queries provide for quick and easy manipulation of data and access to useful database insights. 
The usage of a database also guarantees a level of data integrity based on the enforced data types within our tables. 
Establishing constraints such as primary and foreign keys also allows us to avoid incorrect values and duplicated data which 
gives us confidence that the data we are using is accurate.

# Data Visualization
After completing our initial analysis in MySQL, selected queries were exorted to Power BI, a visualization tool. Data visualization is essential, 
as the grahical representation of data sets provides context to our data and allows us to visualze trends and patterns much more easily.

### Sales and Profit Dashbaord
This dashboard provides graphical illustrations of Maven Toys' sales and profit statistics with the ability to filter the result by multiple categories 
such as Date, Store Location, and Product Category. Such information enables Maven Toys to identify elements of its business which drive sales and profits
most significantly.

# Discussion

### 1. Which product categories drive the biggest profits? Is this the same across store locations?

The Toys and Electronics categories were observed to be the most profitable product categories from January 2017 to September 2018, returning $1.08mil and 
$1.0mil in profits respectively. These account for more than 50% of Maven Toys’ total profit. 

Regarding the Toys category, the sales of Lego Bricks and Action Figures are responsible for the lion’s share of profit, combining for $646,433 with a profit 
margin of 12.5% and 37.5% respectively. 

Of the three products offered in the Electronics category, the profit of $834,944 returned by Colorbuds makes it both the most profitable product of its category 
and overall, in the company. At a profit margin of 53.4% it accounts for 20.80% of all profits realized by Maven Toys. 

Across store locations, the trend of Toys and Electronics being the most profitable categories continues. Electronics is the most profitable category at Airport ($108,197) and Commercial ($287,574) stores, while Toys is the most profitable at Downtown ($630,029) and Residential ($136,214) stores. In all these store locations, Lego Bricks, Action Figures and Colorbuds are highlighted as the most profitable products. 


### 2. Are there any seasonal trends or patterns in the sales data?

The data shows a gradual increase in sales from January ($542,554) to April 2017 ($681,072). Afterwards, sales trends downwards until August ($489,422). Given that this timeframe coincides with the summer season, individuals are likely to be more engaged in outdoor activities which may explain the reason for decreased sales. 

After August, monthly sales trends upwards constantly from $585,844 in September to $661,304 in November. These three months of increases culminate in a massive spike to $877,203 in December, which is the highest sales amount recorded in any month. This end of year occurrence is likely due to increased demand for Christmas. 

In 2018, there is a decrease in monthly sales for two months to $722,632 in February, followed by a significant increase in March to $883,515. For the next six months of 2018, the sales data follows a similar trend to that of 2017, remaining relatively constant from April to June and then decreasing from July to September. 

It should be noted that as of September 2018 ($6.96mil), cumulative sales have exceeded that of September 2017 ($5.32mil) at the same point in time. Taking into consideration that the total sales for 2017 was $7.48mil and the sales data of 2018 follows a similar pattern to that of 2017, Maven Toys should expect to surpass 
that value by the end of the year.  

Examining sales over time by product category reveals vital insights. Despite Electronics being the second most profitable product category, its monthly sales have constantly trended downwards, from $143,088 in January 2021 to $72,547 in September 2022.  This trajectory significantly differs from that of the Toys category, which has been relatively constant, indicating that the demand for the former has decreased while demand for the latter has not changed. 

Given that one of the main money-making product categories has been on a path to decreasing sales over the past twenty months, one must wonder how the company is 
still on course to surpass 2017’s total sales. This is attributed to the substantial growth in sales of the Arts and Crafts category. Monthly sales have trended upwards, from $35,097 in January 2017 to $187,299 in September 2018, including a high of a $230,299 in April 2018. Taking advantage of this increased demand could prove beneficial in further boosting sales for Maven Toys.	  


### 3. Are sales being lost with out-of-stock products at certain locations?

Since each location offers all 35 products, attention is paid to individual stores. 

An initial observation shows that not every store has offered all 35 products from January 2017 – September 2018. Of the 50 stores, 40% of them offered only 30 products or less. One may assume that stores which offered every product will generally have more sales, but this is not necessarily the case. The top two selling stores, Ciudad de Mexico 2 ($554,553) and Guadalajara 3 ($449,354) only offered 30 products. Additionally, of the top 10 selling stores, 5 of them offered only 30 products. 

An observation of products reveals that of the 50 stores, 24 stores did not offer the Monopoly product, 23 stores did not offer the Chutes & Ladders product, 22 stores did not offer the Uno Card Game product, and 20 stores did not offer the Classic Dominoes as well as the Mini Basketball Hop product. Further analysis also shows that these items were among the worst 10 selling products, with none exceeding $100,000 in sales. 

Offering these additional products at stores may not significantly increase sales as these products were not proven to have great demand. 


### 4. How much money is tied up in inventory at the toy stores? How long will it last?

Since each location offers all 35 products, attention is paid to individual stores. 
Based to the current inventory, Maven Toys should expect 410k in sales and 110k in profit across all its stores. This is assuming that all product costs and prices remain the same.

Currently, there are 29,742 units of products across all stores. A high-level overview suggests that this figure is insufficient to meet the monthly demand of customers, as the cumulative monthly average of units sold is approximately 52,000 units. It should be noted however, that the adequacy of stock will vary from store to store. 

Despite a decrease in the number of units sold within the past 3 months, the average amount of units sold has trended upwards. Judging from patterns previously observed, it is likely that demand in the next three months will exceed the monthly average of units sold. If the trend continues, Maven Toys will need to acquire more than its monthly average to meet the end of year demand.
